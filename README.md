# AVR_Blinkled
 here I have explain how to blink the led using AVR programming in arduino 
 
Here in the code we are going to blink the led using avr programming. I know that blinking led is very easy task using arduino. but then why it is required of avr ?
 
 since arduino support to atmega 328p chip which is embeede in it and you can easily make code using ide but when you move to real application you are not going to use ide instead
 
 you have to use different software to run different chips like atmega 32 which can not run through ide you required to use different softrware for it i.e Atmel studio
 
 but for our learning we are using arduino to start and grasp spme basic of it
 
 Here in the blinking led application we are using switch and led which connected to port of PB2 AND PB1 of it.
